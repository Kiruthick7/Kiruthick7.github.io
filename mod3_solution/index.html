        Nothing can match the level of happiness you get when you find your favorite food on the dining table. And if you’re a foodie, this moment is happy enough to make you forget every stress.
        Well, I don’t about you but it happens with me every time I see a chicken dish on my dining table. I jump on with happiness and lose my patience to wait even a single moment. At times, me and my brothers fight like cats and dogs because I always pick out the largest share. Out of unnumbered of chicken dishes, I love ‘Tandoori Chicken’ the most, though I like others too. Whenever my mom asks ‘what you want to have in meal’, I vigorously shout ‘Tandoori Chicken’.
        No matter, how much and how often I eat it, my hunger for Tandoori Chicken never dies. Sometimes, I get scolded that you would gain weight or fall sick eating a whole plate in one sitting but who cares as long as my favorite dish is in front of me. The more crunchy, gravy, spicy, tangy it is, the more I like it. This mouth-watering dish just drives me crazy.
        People say, restaurant foods are the best but I differ. My mom cooks the best Tandoori Chicken in the world. Her cooking skill is the only reason I love this dish so much. If you haven’t tried Tandoori Chicken yet, I must say, you still don’t know what a scrumptious dish tastes like. Try this dish today and now itself. This lip-smacking dish will twist your tongue with its savory flavor.

        Bright orange flames engulf the blackened grill, singeing the tin-foil. The delicious smell of cooking meat wafts into your nose, making your tongue water.
        Steak is the supreme food in the world, due to some key qualities. The diverse range of steaks available, the variety of different cooking methods, and the assorted sides and sauces that comes with it.  
        In addition to your traditional beef steak, there are many more varieties. For example; a chunky salmon steak, wrapped in hot, crispy pastry, with a pinch of salt and pepper. Or a great lump of pork steak, not too dry, cooked absolutely to perfection, with crunchy crackling that just melts in your mouth. Oh yes, there is much more to steak then just a chunk of beef. 
        However, it is not just the type of steak that makes it supreme, it is also the method used to cook it. Most of us just cook it, quick and fast on the stove top, then rest it in tin foil for a couple of minutes. But those steaks you get in restaurants? They cook it long and slow. Although, that is not the only way to cook steak. The best method of cooking is over an open fire, then wrapping the slab of meat in tin foil, the flames infuse the steak with a smokey, charred, delicious flavour.
        Above all though, it is the sides and sauces that come with steak.Gravy,the fatty,delicious sauce that soaks through your steak filling it with the delicious taste, complimenting the steak perfectly.
